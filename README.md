early draft of whitepaper, can be changed anytime.

Our Vision.
Ænomaly, is an open source, decentralized, peer to peer human-curated search engine, where the global search index is governed by the community, and distributed on nodes, focused upon engagement from real humans.  Users are rewarded with tokens for their collective contributions to the ecosystem. Our goal is to build a new model for a tokenized economy which cleans, monitors and distributes a safe and secure internet, built on blockchain technology.

We believe in a free, open and safe Internet for everyone, where the public governs and owns a piece of the internet, it’s completely censorship free from government, free for members to use and we welcome everyone’s help to contribute. Together we can change the future of the web by creating a new type of governed data, managed and hosted by its own users, building a network of taskforce content moderators, to police and monitor the Internet. After all it is our social responsibility to fix the internet. We believe Ænomaly has created a system that can better control, content self-regulation - and not risk a worse solution imposed by politicians.























The Mission.
The Ænomaly protocol is developed in a community driven model without any single point of failure. Community consensus decision-making is the core governance of the ecosystem, by becoming a decentralised and distributed online service provider for access to an approved global URI whitelist and blacklist index, that is governed by the content moderators, decentralized democracy using a peer to peer network to deliver content through a new ecosystem, for a clean and safe internet browsing experience for the end user.

Our solution comes with a desktop, mobile and tablet browser, extensions/plugins for all major  browsers. An integrated reviewing, rating and voting platform to help clean and categorically organised the internet. With our a peer to peer search engine with a global search index that’s decentralized, transparent marketplace for work that requires human content moderators, secure cryptocurrency wallet and for extra security we have added force all web connections to https, block unwanted ads, website blocker, tracking and anti malware scripts to keep you safe from the dangers of the internet, plus many more features.

We believe the web of today will be the interface to the decentralized web of tomorrow. By becoming one of the first browsers to open up to Web 3.0, Ænomaly will contribute to making the internet of the future, safe and easy for anyone to use.


Community decide what is right for everyone, then catarigise.

Harmful and Dangerous Content. Harmful and dangerous content online can be viewed by anyone including children and vulnerable adults.

Phishing, Fake & Scams Online. Fake and scam website flourish on the internet phishing innocent and vulnerable victims in their fraudulent scams.

Adult Rated Content. Unfortunately, sexual images and pornography are easily and trivially accessed on the Internet by anyone, of any age.

Censorship of the Internet. Governments and large corporations motivations for censorship range from well-intentioned desires to protect children from unsuitable content, to authoritarian attempts to control a nation's access to information.

Trolls and Cyberbullying. Malicious people use technology like the internet to bully, harass, threaten or target another person with aggressive, or rude texts, tweets, posts, or messages.

Fake News Online. However, hoaxes and falsehoods have been associated with the internet since its early days.

The Tracking, Privacy and Security. The tracking of personal data and online of personal data problems with browsing the internet today needs addressing.

Age Verification ID. Age Verification ID systems are centralized, personal and sensitive data is at risk of being hacked or sold for profit, making it unsafe, insecure or anonymous.

ICN-based internet. ICN-based internet where all packages URI’s are reviewed, rated and voted community members.

Ubiquitous Ownership and Access. Everybody should have a right to possess a piece of it.
Mesh networks future proof. It should work in every connected surrounding.
Interplanetary scale. It should work on Earth and Mars.
Tolerant. In the era of machine learning, it should work for any kind of thinking beasts.
Open and Accessible. Everybody should be able to bring a bit to a quality of search results.
Blockchain Agnostic. Foundations behind its design should not rely on any protocol or stack rather be explicitly derived from the nature of the information itself.
Beautiful and user friendly. The economics model should not harm the user experience.
Transparency and Trustfulness. Every piece of its reasoning and behavior must be auditable by everybody.
No Single Point of Failure. Nobody should have a single key to modify or change it.
Sybil Attacks Resistant. This resistance should be derived from the properties of a free market but not from some single authority.
Intelligent Answers. It should answer natural questions with easy to read and provable answers no matter text, media or natural numbers should be involved in the answer.

Why a new human-curated search engine is needed.
No Transparency
Nobody outside (and probably inside) of Google understands how the ranking really works. This creates a market for black and white SEO. The truth is that if e.g. Google discloses complete details of the ranking algorithm it would be easy for adversaries to game organic search results that kill the quality of results and ad revenue streams. Google's approach to Sybil resistance is in fact KYC and captcha. Using modern technologies this problem can be addressed using accountable consensus computer with properly designed economic incentives.
No Access
Currently, all search engines are centralized. Nobody is able to add to index as well as participate in improving the quality of search results. However, Google itself internally uses a workforce of search evaluators. It is our belief that user-generated search engine could have a higher quality of results as in a story with almost every website in existence.
Broken Incentives
The vast majority of contribution to a search quality is made by users. When any user searches something she extends semantic core. When any user clicks on search results she trains a model. This creates an opportunity to continuously improve ranking model at the expense of users. Then search engines sell users to advertisers at the expense of harming user experience and acquire revenue streams which are not returned back to users at all. This simple loop created Alphabet's ~ $780 billion capitalization (~ $100 per Earth capita) in 20 years. We need to change that.
Central Control
Google become too powerful. It is scary to imagine a future where everything about everybody is known and controlled by closed AI corporation. Imagine the world where (1) the only country exist, (2) nobody can control its government and (3) everybody should obey the decision of government without any explanation. There should be open, transparent and accessible alternative with decentralized control built on principles of modern distributed interplanetary content-addressable syberspace [HUAN] and DAO like governance [RALF].
Annoying Ads
Separation for organic and ad search results is unnecessary. In fact, all organic ranking decisions are being made by search authority. But for paid search Google use free-market solution to determine a fair ad price for every word in its gigantic semantic core. Historically free market solutions are proven to be more efficient in virtually any area of decision making. Why do not use the same principle for the ranking itself disintermediating annoying ads? Let us imagine that every link (1) can be submited by everybody, (2) based on this actions some rank can be computed and then (3)those who predict content with higher rank in the future will benefit more. This non-zero-sum game is significantly more Sybil-resistant, hence that is there we are heading.
One-Way Trust
Everybody are used to trust Google, Baidu, and Yandex. But Google, Baidu, and Yandex don't trust users. You cannot know what happens inside Google, Baidu, and Yandex because they don't trust us. But they know everything what happens inside us. We want to establish a system where trust is bidirectional between a search engine and an agents because search engine ownership is distributed across all its agents based on which all ranking decisions are made.
Zero Privacy
All search engines will answer you only if they explicitly know how to map your device with your real identity or pseudo-identity which is tracked by realtime bidding ecosystem. Otherwise, you should prove that you are not a robot every time you search. That harms our privacy. That harms our experience. That basicaly sucks. Real privacy is very expensive in consensus computers at this stage of development. But we need to find workarounds.
Censorship
content is censored
Online only
Worth to note that you cannot search offline even if necessary information is stored next door. If we are cut from the wire or backbone we powerless. Global offline search is not a feature which can be easily deployed even by a multibillion corporation. This goal is nearly impossible to achieve based on centralized architecture using TCP/IP-DNS-HTTP stack. Only content addresable distributed systems can solve this fundamental problem for the next generation Internet. This future is not about gateway keepers in form of ISPs but about mesh networking and peer-to-peer communications built for interplanetary scale in mind.
Weak Security
What happens if tomorrow my Google account will be blocked? Do we have something to prevent this? Do we have the necessary level of assurance that guarantee us our security based on math and not on the complicated legal tender? All technical solutions are here but to solve this important issue we need some effort from everybody.

Reviewing, Rating and Voting Platform.

The reviewing platform will be the heart of the ecosystem, used to clean and rate the internet, websites, videos, news and trolls will be judged based on the content it provides to the world, review, rate, vote and approval websites is all governed through the community consensus mechanism.

Participation in reviewing and rating websites and members (by rating other members on their truthful engagements in participating in the governance of websites, identify or report problems).

Building the Ænomaly Ecosystem.

Option 1: Oracles

Oracle can configure protocol it is expecting to exchange request-response.
Oracle can configure fee for it's services (on the top of regular blockchain fee).

So, as we mention, Ænomaly want to use humans to proofread content, they could be represented by oracles.

Requests to oracles would be lists of e.g. URLs to check, and oracles would answer if they are good/bad.

Answers would be results of proof reads by humans. They would get the fee they ask.

All answers would be available in the chain to pick up by some proxy/gateway behind browser.


Option 2: TCR - Token-Curated Registries

Mike Goldin - ConsenSys

Token-curated registries are increasingly common cryptosystems apparently applicable to solving problems in a number of domains. In this document we will provide a more formal but less-than-mathematical view of token-curated registries.

Many token-curated registries being deployed today bear family resemblance but employ substantively different mechanics. We believe there is a “right” way to do token-curated registries and that wholesale reuse of a canonical implementation should be possible.

This document is versioned because the cryptosystem and incentive game described here can almost certainly be improved. Hopefully this document can be used as a starting point for conversations around how to improve token-curated registries.

The utility of token-curated registries
The product or output of a token-curated registry is a list. Humans have a penchant for list-making and lists appear commonly: shopping lists, lists of good restaurants, lists of America’s most wanted criminals, and many more. Most lists can be abstractly classified as either whitelists or blacklists, and in both cases the contents of a list uniformly satisfy some criteria, e.g. things I need to cook, restaurants that satisfy their customers, and individuals with FBI bounties over $100,000.

Useful lists are curated. Often by a single individual in the case of a grocery list, and perhaps by a committee in the case of a top-colleges list. A top-colleges list which may be appended by anybody quickly becomes an all-colleges list and ceases to be useful, since any college president obviously would desire for their college to appear on such a list.

A token-curated registry uses an intrinsic token to assign curation rights proportional to the relative token weight of entities holding the token. So long as there are parties which would desire to be curated into a given list, a market can exist in which the incentives of rational, self-interested token holders are aligned towards curating a list of high quality. Token-curated registries are decentrally-curated lists with intrinsic economic incentives for token holders to curate the list’s contents judiciously.

User views: consumers, candidates, and token holders
There are three user types in a token-curated registry and each has different interests, incentives, and interaction patterns towards the registry. Consumers desire high-quality lists. Candidates desire to be included in such lists. Token holders desire to increase the price of the tokens they hold.

Consumers desire high-quality information. If a consumer is making decisions about where to eat dinner on the basis of a list purported to only contain “good” restaurants, they will be disappointed if they find listed a restaurant that has previously given them food poisoning. They will likely cease using the list as a reference or recommending it to friends.

Candidates desire the attention and consideration of consumers. Restaurants on a top restaurants list will likely see more customers than they otherwise would without the listing. In our terminology, “listees” are candidates which have been admitted to a registry.

Token holders desire to keep demand for the token they hold high, as this increases its price. Token holders may be otherwise disinterested in the contents of the list they are curating: in our example of a top restaurants list, the token holders need be neither consumers nor candidates of/to the registry. To keep demand for their token high, token holders must keep candidates desirous of having listings in the registry by maintaining consumer interest in the registry by keeping the quality of listings high. Stated in reverse, if the quality of listings are high, then consumers will be interested in the registry such that candidates will desire to be listed in the registry. Token holders realize a direct financial benefit for curating the list in an expert manner, and the degree of their benefit increases proportionally to the quality of their curation as consumer and candidate interest rise in lockstep.

The incentive system of token-curated registries
Token holders are the engine of a crypto economic game which curates a token-curated registry. To make a token-curated registry work, candidates must make a deposit denominated in the registry’s intrinsic token to be considered for listing. If a candidate is “good” and accepted as a listee they keep this deposit, and may withdraw it at any time should they desire to terminate their listing. If a candidate is “bad” its application may be challenged by token holders and, if rejected, its deposit is forfeited and divvied up as a reward amongst token holders who participated in the challenge process.

Candidates will not apply to the registry who believe they would obviously be rejected, as this would result in a financial loss for them. A college which only offers majors in bird-watching and charges tuition of $50,000 per year is so unlikely to be admitted to a registry of colleges whose students exit debt on average within 10 years that, rationally, they should not bother to apply. It is candidates on the margin of likely acceptance to the registry from whom token holders stand to increase their holdings, as these candidates have non-zero likelihood of both applying and being successfully challenged.

Token holders have a tactical incentive to challenge and reject every candidate to their registry in the interest of increasing their holdings, but this is at odds with their strategic interest of increasing the value of their holdings. An empty list is of no interest to consumers, so candidates would not bother applying to it. Candidates drive fundamental demand for a registry’s intrinsic token, and so by behaving tactically rather than strategically, token holders go against their own interests and incur a potentially severe financial loss. Generally, it is in the interest of economically rational token holders to behave strategically and curate a high-quality list.

Parameters of a token-curated registry
This section may be used as a reference, these parameters will be referred to later. Collectively, we may refer to them as “the parameters”, particularly as “snapshots” of the parameters, and also as “current canonical” parameters. A snapshot of the parameters capture the current canonical parameters as they are at some time, and parameters in a snapshot are frozen: they do not change even if the underlying current canonical parameters do. If not otherwise specified, a reference to some parameter is a reference to the current canonical parameter.

MIN_DEPOSIT
The number of tokens a candidate must lock as a deposit for their application, and for the duration of their listing thereafter.

APPLY_STAGE_LEN
The duration, in blocks or epoch time, during which an application can be challenged. If this period passes with no challenge being issued, the candidate becomes a listee.

COMMIT_PERIOD_LEN
The duration, in blocks or epoch time, during which token holders can commit votes for a particular challenge.

REVEAL_PERIOD_LEN
The duration, in blocks or epoch time, during which token holders can reveal committed votes for a particular challenge.

DISPENSATION_PCT
The percentage of the forfeited deposit in a challenge which is awarded to the winning party as a special dispensation compensating for their capital risk.

MINORITY_BLOC_SLASH
The percentage of tokens in the losing vote bloc disbursed to the winning bloc as additional rewards.

VOTE_QUORUM
The percentage of tokens out of the total tokens revealed in favor of admitting/keeping a challenged candidate necessary for that candidate to get/keep listee status. The VOTE_QUORUM does not count non-voting tokens, and unrevealed tokens are considered non-voting. By way of example, a VOTE_QUORUM of 50 means all challenges are simple majority votes.

Listings
A listing is one member in the uniform set of listed items contained in a token-curated registry. For a token-curated registry of top restaurants, a listing could be a simple string identifying the restaurant by its well-known name, e.g. “Per Se”. An important consideration in deciding the form a listing should take is that the real thing be authenticable against the listing. In the case of top-colleges this is easy and names suffice, as spoofing the physical and social institution of a listed university to defraud consumers requires a significant proof-of-work (fake campus, staff, forged identities).

The means of authentication should, to the extent possible, be left to the discretion of the consumer. Consumers of a registry which stores domain names on the basis of some criteria may authenticate their connections to such domains in any number of ways: under the HTTPS certificate regime, web-of-trust, or using hashed secrets stored in listing metadata provided as an attestation from some oracle. It is important that listees and consumers establish at least one de facto means of authentication which both can support, or the registry will not ultimately be useful.

Applications
When a candidate for listing in a token-curated registry decides to take the step of actually applying for a listing, an application process begins. To make an application, a candidate must make a deposit in the registry’s intrinsic token of at least MIN_DEPOSIT, where MIN_DEPOSIT is the number of tokens at stake should a challenge arise. Once an application is made, it can be resolved after APPLY_STAGE_LEN if no challenge was raised in that period. An application which resolves with no challenge results in the candidate becoming a listee.

An application which is challenged resolves at the conclusion of the challenge, and the candidate’s status is determined then by the result of the challenge.

An application stores a snapshot of the current canonical parameters when it is instantiated, and all actions taken on or against an application reference its snapshotted parameters.



Challenges
Challenges may be initiated against candidates in their application period, or against listees. There may not be more than one challenge active against a candidate or listee at a given time. A challenge is initiated by putting at stake a deposit of MIN_DEPOSIT against some application or listing whose deposit is of at least MIN_DEPOSIT (see “touch-and-remove” for challenges against listings whose deposits are less than MIN_DEPOSIT).

When a challenge is instantiated, a snapshot of the registry’s current canonical parameters are stored with the challenge and a vote begins (see: Voting) in which any token holder can participate. At the vote’s conclusion, either the challenger or candidate’s deposit is forfeited. DISPENSATION_PCT percent of the forfeited deposit is awarded to the winning party in the challenge as compensation for that party’s capital risk. The remainder of the forfeited deposit is awarded to voters in the majority voting bloc according to token weight. Token voters in the minority voting bloc neither lose tokens nor receive any reward.

If the challenge was made against an application, then at its conclusion the application is deleted and the candidate may or may not become a listee. If the challenge was made against a listing, then at its conclusion the listing may or may not be deleted.

Edge case: “touch-and-remove”
If a challenge is made against a listing whose deposit is less than the current canonical MIN_DEPOSIT, the listing is immediately removed and the deposits of both challenger and listee are returned. This can occur when a candidate becomes a listee having posted some snapshotted deposit amount, and at some point after the snapshot was taken the current canonical MIN_DEPOSIT increases.

Why touch-and-remove? First, accept that deposit amounts in challenges must be of equal value, lest token-voters behave in a manner biased by a rational financial incentive to defeat the party with the larger deposit (as this gives them a larger payout). Having accepted that, why not specify deposits sizes in challenges always be matched against the deposit of the challenged listing? It is possible that a deposit of some amount could, on the basis of the deposited token’s market price, become of less value than the gas and opportunity cost the challenger, and particularly voters, would incur by initiating and participating in the challenge. Touch-and-remove mitigates the opportunity for registry poisoning which could be done by listings whose deposits are too small to challenge by giving strategically-minded, activist token holders discretion to simply remove such listings at a minimal cost.

For honest listings to guard against touch-and-remove griefing should the canonical MIN_DEPOSIT increase, listees can make deposits as large as they like, and any amount over the current canonical MIN_DEPOSIT may be withdrawn at any time. In a challenge, the current canonical MIN_DEPOSIT tokens are snapshotted at challenge instantiation and only that amount are ever at stake.

Voting
The critical game-theoretic considerations of voting in token-curated registries are that it be token-weighted and commit-reveal. Beyond that, voting need not be implemented in any particular way strictly speaking, but consideration should be given to the efficiency of the voting mechanism in terms of token liquidity.

Token-weightedness is important to give those with the most at stake the most say in the registry’s curation, as these token holders are most incentivized to exercise the greatest diligence. Commit-reveal is important so as not to let the voting process itself influence voters to vote in any other way than that which they feel will be most productive for the registry’s curation. Token liquidity should be maximized to the extent possible so as to encourage participation in the voting process.

Partial-lock commit/reveal voting is presently the most efficient known token voting mechanism for token-curated registries.

Parameterization
The parameters of a token-curated registry must be responsive to the market dynamics of the registry’s intrinsic token. For example, if the market price of the token declines such that application volume increases to a point where token holders cannot effectively audit all of the applications being made, the MIN_DEPOSIT parameter should be increased in response. How parameterization, which is really registry governance, can be done best is considered an open question at this time.

In Ænomaly, for the purposes of example, parameterization is done on a similar basis as listing applications. A different set of the same parameters are used such that MIN_DEPOSIT might be much higher to propose a re-parameterization than it is to apply for a listing. Reparameterization proposals are challengeable, with the tokens deposited being at stake for both proposer and challenger. Token holders can vote to reparameterize the registry parameters, or the parameters of the parameterizer itself.

Interesting properties of token-curated registries
The intrinsic tokens of token-curated registries are necessary elements of self-sustaining systems which are public utilities. Token-curated registries are peak predators of capitalism that perform a useful function at the lowest possible marginal cost.

Token-curated registries satisfy the tenets of Mike’s Cryptosystems Manifesto
A token is a necessary element of a system if the use of any other in its place would damage the system’s normal functioning. Token-curated registries require intrinsic tokens because token holders must realize both the upside and downside of their good or bad work in order to be motivated to perform their essential curation task. The price of Bitcoin will not be responsive to reduced demand for it in the application of registry listings, meaning token holders’ only incentives would be to take all the Bitcoin they could from candidates by issuing spurious challenges and colluding on votes against the interest of the registry’s curation criteria. A token whose only fundamental utility is its necessity for making applications to some registry will see its price fluctuate on the basis of demand for those listings, which is determined by the quality of curation done by token holders. Token-curated registries satisfy token-necessity.

A system is self-sustaining if it would continue to function normally in the indefinite absence of its creators. No entity has special privilege in a token-curated registry. All tokens are equal and only token weight determines the weight of one’s privilege in a registry. The creator of a token-curated registry can disappear and the closed-loop incentive system of the token-curated registry is indifferent. Token-curated registries are truly decentralized systems. Token-curated registries satisfy self-sustainability.

A system is a public utility if it is permissionless, rent-free, and do something useful. Token-curated registries are permissionless, as they are truly decentralized, and only token weight determines privilege. They are rent-free, as tokens are never at stake which are not necessary to incentivize other actors to perform some necessary task, or to disincentivize actors from griefing attacks. Token-curated registries produce useful output, which are the curated contents of their lists. Token-curated registries satisfy public utility.

Peak predators of capitalism
A peak predator of capitalism is a system which produces some useful output at the lowest possible marginal cost. The output of token-curated registries are absolutely free for consumers to make use of: the lists are stored on the blockchain and are totally transparent for any party to read. Rather than paying a vendor to produce a list of some sort, consumers in token-curated registries consume at no cost the product of an entire market of vendors competing against one another to produce the best list a free market can produce.

An entity which believes it can improve a token-curated registry’s quality by playing its incentive game better can buy its token at market price, increase candidate demand for the token by increasing consumer interest having bettered the registry’s curation, and exit their position having turned a profit to an entity which believes it can do even better than that. Alternatively, a token holder who is good at issuing challenges and voting can realize a perpetual revenue stream just by selling the tokens they win in the incentive game without ever parting with their principal.

In this way, if the market for tokens is efficient, the intrinsic tokens of token-curated registries become optimally dispersed over time to the entities which can use them most productively. In token-curated registries, profitability and productivity are well-aligned.

Attacks against token-curated registries and mitigations
There are a number of theorized attacks against token-curated registries. In addition, there are likely attacks which exist that have not yet been theorized or witnessed. Known attacks and their mitigations are discussed here in the author’s subjective severity/complexity/uncertainty order.

Simple trolling
A troll, for any arbitrary reason, might like to add listings to a registry which do not satisfy the registry’s essential criteria. A troll desires to add “bad” listings to a “good” registry. Such attacks should be expensive and ineffective against a well-tended registry: the troll applies with a low-quality listing and loses their deposit when a rational token holder issues a successful challenge. To overcome the rationality of token-voters performing their essential function in the registry, the simple trolling attack must escalate to a madman attack.

Madman attacks
A well-resourced adversary may have rational incentives to spend a large amount of capital destroying a token-curated registry by purchasing a challenge-proof majority of its active voting tokens and populating the registry with low-quality listings. If a registry performs some useful function at near-zero marginal cost and destroys existing businesses in doing so, it may be in the interest of those businesses to spend money to acquire tokens at market price and then destroy their value by poisoning the registry.

Happily, the security properties of token-curated registries against such majority validator attacks are rather similar to those of Casper. In economic 51% attacks, the attacker’s weapon can be destroyed in a hard fork. As per Vitalik, “the intention is to make 51% attacks extremely expensive, so that even a majority of validators working together cannot roll back finalized blocks without undertaking an extremely large economic loss — a loss so large that a successful attack would likely on net increase the price of the underlying cryptocurrency as the market would more strongly react to the reduction in total coin supply than it would to the need for an emergency hard fork to correct the attack.” In token-curated registries, the validators are token holders.

A practical concern is that only a minority of tokens are likely to be active participants in voting at any given time (see: Bootstrapping), such that madman attacks may not be as expensive as the label “majority validator attack” suggests. Mitigating passive token-holding is an important open question in token-curated registries.

Registry poisoning
Registry poisoning is an attack performed not by a token holder but by a listing. In a registry poisoning attack, a listed entity becomes of degraded quality after being admitted to the registry. A college in the high-quality colleges registry might take advantage of its listing status by raising tuitions such that students who apply on the basis of its listing status find later that most of them have not exited debt after 10 years.

Rational token holders should be active in discovering such behavior and issue challenges against listed entities poisoning the registry. One underexplored concern is that registry poisoning may become relatively cheap if a listing only waits until the MIN_DEPOSIT increases over its canonical value at that listing’s application time such that it would be touch-and-removed upon discovery of its malfeasance. The listing then would not actually forfeit its original deposit. Still, the entity would have lost the opportunity for re-listing by damaging its reputation as such.

Coin flipping and vote memeing
Because there are no direct penalties for making bad decisions in voting, token holders may find it is more profitable to “flip coins” on their votes than spend the time making sober assessments of the issues at stake. This is an example of an attack which is only mitigated by the long-term strategic interests of token-voters to maximize demand for their token, but it is not known the extent to which such concerns will weigh on the necessary critical mass of token-voters to prevent such behavior. Coin flipping is not a very damaging attack: assuming an even distribution of votes between choices from coin-flippers, a minority of activist token holders can tip the scale towards rationality in any challenge.

“Vote memeing” is a group behavior where it becomes a meme to always vote one way or another in the interest of always being in the majority voting bloc, and is a similar attack to coin-flipping in terms of what motivates it, but with worse effects since a minority of activist token holders cannot tip the scale in favor of rationality.

Coin-flipping and vote memeing are considered a complex attack because they speak to the limits of rationality of token holders (See: Limits of rationality).

Open questions in token-curated registries
Limits of rationality
In general, there are strategies in token-curated registries which may be rational to pursue in the short-term, but which are harmful in the long term. Passive token-holding itself is undesirable, coin-flipping and vote memeing are short-term rational but reduce the registry’s quality over time. What optimal strategies will participants pursue? Might some participants play the tactical and others the strategic game such that the lists which result are of middling quality, worse than those which can be centrally curated?

Bootstrapping
Token-curated registries have a chicken-and-egg problem. Consumers will have no interest in an empty list, nor will candidates desire to apply to a registry consumers have no interest in. In general it will be difficult for a registry to gain sufficient interest and traction from any of the necessary participants in order to instantiate a token-curated registry’s virtuous and self-sustaining steady-state. There are a diverse set of opinions on the optimal approach to instantiating a token-curated registry and no single approach has proven to be the clear pattern to follow.

One approach is to collaborate with relevant “legacy” governing bodies for a candidate group (industry lobbies, advisory boards, et cetera) and offering them the responsibility of curating an initial set of registrants. The motivation behind this approach is to leverage the industry expertise of the vetted curators in order to produce a compelling base set of registry listings.

Another approach might be to initially distribute registry tokens to potential consumers and candidates of a registry. This gives otherwise disinterested parties tangible upside in seeding the system themselves.

Minimum economy size
What is the minimum size of an economy necessary to support the decentralized curation of a list in this way? Is it economical to decentrally curate a grocery list? Would it be rational for the producers of packaged goods and foodstuffs to make applications to a registry of things which should be purchased at the grocery store? Would dispersed token-voters be able to curate a list useful to the shopper? How would they know whether or not the shopper already has enough cheese? What is the minimum value of consumer interest necessary to decentrally curate a list?

Parameterization
Parameterization of registries is not considered well-solved at this time. It is possible that the Ænomaly parameterizer, for example, could be put into a permanently untenable state. For example, the parameterizer’s MIN_DEPOSIT could be set to zero. This would create a very cheap opportunity for trolls to keep the MIN_DEPOSIT set to zero in perpetuity, since a large number of proposals could be created following the success of the initial attack, which could then be processed and activated at any later date. The Ænomaly parameterizer depends on token holders exercising diligence to prevent such an initial attack from succeeding. Registries can recover from lapses in token holder diligence and poisoning by means of the challenge mechanism, but parameterizers can be permanently damaged if successfully attacked once.




1. Motivation
Sometimes people do bad things. Some of the bad things people can do include not paying freelancers for their work, or freelancers submitting compromised work. There should be a generalized solution for individuals with minimal reputation to prove their willingness to be punished for bad behavior, to parties which have no other reason to trust them.

2. Summary
To punish people on a blockchain, you have to take their tokens. The only way to take people’s tokens from across the Internet is if they have staked them to a system with the power to seize them. An entity which has staked tokens in Ænomaly is called a staker.
To punish stakers, claims need to be submitted against them. In Ænomaly, a claim is submitted by a challenger, who provides necessary evidence to support their claim. But who adjudicates claims? In Ænomaly, the selection of adjudicators is deferred to a token-curated registry (TCR). TCRs are incentive games with intrinsic economic incentives for token holders to curate the registry’s contents judiciously and continuously. In this case, the registry contains entities capable of justly adjudicating in general disputes. Entities registered in the Ænomaly TCR are called arbiters, and have deposits at stake which they are at hazard to lose should token holders judge they are adjudicating poorly. Arbiters collect fees in exchange for their service when they share a plurality opinion in adjudicating a claim.
Ænomaly also has means to punish spurious claim-making, and limits the ability to grief accused entities through claim spam. In Ænomaly, challengers stake the arbitration fee when bringing claims. If the arbiters rule in favour of the challenger, this fee is returned to them along with their claim amount, both of which are drawn from the original deposit of the accused staker. However, if the arbiters reject the claim, the challenger’s deposit pays the arbitration fee for the claim. Arbitration fees are split among the plurality voting bloc of arbiters in each claim, following a decay function based on the order in which votes are cast.
This is a simple staking and arbitration mechanism, to punish evil people all across the Internet.
3. Protocol Specification
3.1 Becoming a Staker with Ænomaly
Individuals enter Ænomaly when they deposit a stake amount (Si), which serves as the pot against which claims can be made. Stakes can be in ETH or any ERC-20 token, and must be homogeneous. A single user can have stakes S0in ETH and S1in TRKY, for example, but can not have a single stake consisting of both ETH and TRKY.
Upon entry, stakers specify a lockup period which serves as the minimum waiting time before any request to withdraw staked funds may be executed. The lockup period provides a window of opportunity for  claims to be made against a fleeing staker before their funds are permanently withdrawn. If a claim is created after a withdrawal is requested but before the lockup period has elapsed, the lockup period is frozen pending resolution of that claim. Once the claim is resolved, the lockup timer resumes. As a self-specified parameter, lockup periods may freely respond to market forces incentivizing stakers to specify longer or shorter lockup periods.
Stakers must also specify the minimum fee which must be paid to arbiters for new claims, so that challengers may not open claims which will never be adjudicated upon (as they are below the minimum threshold of fees that the arbiters are willing to accept).
3.2 Becoming a Challenger with Ænomaly
In order to open claims against a specific stake, an individual must first be whitelisted to do so by the staker. This serves to limit spurious claims made by unknown individuals who might otherwise, for relatively little cost, prevent the staker from withdrawing their stake in a timely manner. Individuals going into business with a staker who should like to be able to make claims in the event of malfeasance should not begin their work until the staker has approved them for claims.
3.3 Creating a Claim Against a Staker
Any individual can create a claim against someone who has staked funds with Ænomaly by specifying a claim amount (C) against a stake and depositing an arbitration fee (F) in the same token as the stake. The claim amount and fee are bounded by the original stake Si, such that:
C + F  ≤  Si
This constraint ensures that the staker has sufficient funds to pay both the claim amount and arbitration fee in the event that the claim against them is found justified. The size of the arbitration fee Fcan respond to market forces to ensure that at least one arbiter will rule on a claim within a reasonable time period.
When a claim is created, the challenger’s funds F and the staker’s funds C + Fare locked up pending a settlement between the parties or a ruling by the arbiters. The staker’s remaining stake Si'=Si-C - F  remains locked up with Ænomaly, and further claims may be made against it.
3.4 Pre-Arbitration
Once a claim is created, a pre-arbitration phase begins where both sides are able to propose settlements to each other. Settlement is desirable both to avoid losing the arbitration fee Fand, for parties which believe a rational arbiter would rule against them, having an arbiter decide the resolution of the dispute. If the parties agree to a resolution amount (R), the challenger receives (R+F), and the sum (C+F-R) is returned to the staker’s main deposit. R may not be larger than the sum (C+F). 
At any point, either side can decide they won’t accept any settlements, and advance the claim into full arbitration. 
3.5 Full Arbitration
Once a claim enters full arbitration, it sits in a pool of outstanding claims waiting for at least one arbiter to cast a vote towards its resolution. Arbiters will be eligible to rule on a given claim if they belong to the arbiter registry the staker has specified, and if they have been randomly chosen. Random selection will be based on the blockhash when a claim is created (b), and the address of a given arbiter from the registry (a). A given arbiter may vote on a given claim if
 uint(keccak256(a,b)) mod 2 = 1 
The result of this is that only a randomly selected half of the registry is eligible to vote on any given claim.
Since rational arbiters will vote on claims in order of their fees, F dictates how quickly adjudication begins. To expedite the beginning of the claim resolution process, either party may increase F by depositing a surplus fee Fsurplus. This surplus deposit is always split amongst the adjudicating arbiters, regardless of how the claim is resolved.
Arbiters rule on submitted claims by committing a salted hash of their vote, which is one of four options:
The claim is justified
The challenger receives C+F, the staker loses C+F, and the arbiters share a fee F+Fsurplus.
The claim is not justified 
The staker is returned their stake C+F, the challenger loses F, and the arbiters share F+Fsurplus.
The claim is collusive
The challenger and staker both relinquish all deposits and fees associated with the claim, and the amount of 2F+Fsurplus is shared amongst the arbiters. The remaining claim amount C is burned. This acts as punishment for any possible collusion between the staker and challenger, which could enable a staker to withdraw their funds (through a proxy) faster than their lock-up period would otherwise allow.
The claim cannot be resolved
Here, all funds, including the respective fee deposits of both sides are returned to the challenger and the staker. This logic is also executed in the event of a tie between plurality voting blocs. The remainder Fsurplusis split among the plurality of arbiters (or all arbiters, in the case of a tie).

Whenever fees are split among arbiters, only those who voted with the plurality will be eligible to receive them. Because votes are first committed in secret and later revealed, this encourages a natural schelling point to emerge on the correct option.

After the first arbiter commits their vote, the commit period begins which provides a window of opportunity for additional arbiters to commit votes. Once the commit period is completed, arbiters reveal their votes, which are tabulated to determine a resolution. Votes can only be revealed during the reveal period, after which all voting is finalized and the claim is resolved. Votes which are committed but never revealed are not counted. The commit and reveal periods are specified by the arbiters.
Once a claim is resolved, the ruling cannot be reversed and no appeals can be made.
3.6 Arbiter Selection
Arbiters who may adjudicate in some claim are said to be members of the claim’s arbiter set. For some stake Si, an arbiter set is specified which may adjudicate claims against that stake. The arbiter sets employed across Ænomaly may be myriad, and these arbiter sets need not be token-curated registries. The remainder of this paper will describe an arbiter set which is a TCR, and its relationship to Ænomaly.
A set of generalist, non-specialized arbiters will initially be curated for Ænomaly using a token-curated registry. A listed entity in the Ænomaly TCR may be a trustworthy individual, an accountable group, or any arbitrarily complex smart contract that satisfies the subjective criteria of the registry’s token holders for credibility in the capacity to justly adjudicate disputes. 
Applying for listing in the Ænomaly arbiters TCR follows the normal conventions of TCR applications, where the applicant begins by supplying a deposit in the registry’s intrinsic token. Out-of-band, the applicant appeals to token holders regarding their suitability for listing in the given arbiter set by furnishing convincing proof-of-identity and relevant credentials for that identity (e.g., “I am the retired former mayor of West Windsor, NJ, and here is a tweet from my longstanding twitter account attesting to my owning the Ethereum account 0xdeadbeef, with which I have applied to the registry.”).
3.7 Arbiter Incentives
A rational, risk-neutral arbiter in the Ænomaly TCR will in any instance take the most profitable action  from a set of all possible actions (A) pertaining to a claim. Since for any action , there exists a probability that the arbiter will be punished for that action (Ppunish()), we can conclude that the value of any action taken (V) must be greater than the product of the arbiter’s stake in the TCR (Vstake) and the probability of the stake being lost through expulsion from the registry.
    A, Ppunish()Vstake < V     [Rational action inequality]
For an action  which entails the receipt of a bribe, the value of the action (V) is the sum of the bribe and the fees they may receive for a given ruling.
V= Vfees+Vbribe     [Bribed action value]
An arbiter may be bribed to take some bribed action if the rational action inequality is satisfied, and is more profitable than any other action in A:
 A,  , V<V      [Misbehaving criteria]
It is rational for parties in claims to offer bribes up to the amount they stand to lose. In claims with a single adjudicating arbiter, the bound is:
 Vbribe <  C + F     [Single arbiter bribing bound]
Since an arbiter’s V is maximized when they are the only voting party, we use this case to see if the action satisfies the Misbehaving criteria.
A rational arbiter will rule that a claim is collusive so as to earn their share of the sum of all fees associated with the claim (2F+Fsurplus), if for the action where the claim is ruled collusive:
 Ppunish()Vstake < 2Factual+Fsurplus     [Single arbiter collusion danger bound]  
Practically, increasing Fusing the Fsurplus mechanism is a means to incentivize additional arbiters to join in the adjudication of a claim (in addition to increasing the speed with which a first arbiter arrives). Increasing the number of voters (numVoters) in a claim increases the cost of successfully executing a bribe. For some homogeneous set of arbiters:
Vbribe(1 + floor( numVoters2)) < C+F     [Multi arbiter bribing bound]  
Similarly, for the action where a claim is ruled collusive:
 Ppunish()Vstake< 2Factual+Fsurplus(1 + floor( numVoters2))     [Multi arbiter collusion danger bound]  



Gateway to Blockchain
At Ænomaly we have thought long and hard about the problems we are solving, and for one blockchain scalability is not one of them.

The Ænomaly team have looked at all the available smart contract based projects in the industry todate and have chosen the æternity blockchain as being the best project to build the Ænomaly ecosystem. 
 
Great features of working on the aeternity blockchain to develop the Ænomaly ecosystem.

Industrial Grade Code Base
Our core blockchain code is written in Erlang, which makes it easy to write distributed, fault-tolerant, soft real-time and highly available non-stop applications. Erlang is the perfect choice to write a blockchain from scratch allowing to achieve superior operational stability and performance.

Blockchain Networks
æternity technology is free to use and easy to incorporate.​ Open Source (ISC) licensed modules will allow easy implementation in blockchain consortiums and will enable free and open access for developers to be able to build on the æternity platform. Cross-chain atomic swaps do the rest.

State Channels
State channels enable highly scalable, trustless transactions of value and purely functional, easily verifiable turing-complete smart contracts. State channels effortlessly support an immense throughput of transactions. The execution as well as settlement happens off-chain. In other words: They are one-to-one- side-chains, where the blockchain acts as a public crypto court.

Oracles
A crucial feature for most contracts, whether encoded as text or as code, is the ability to refer to values from the environment. The æternity Oracle Machine provides real-world data to the blockchain. Each user can ask questions about the environment and the oracle provides the answer. The consensus mechanism comes into play in case of disagreement.

Scripting Languages
Aeternity has a high-level, OCaml based scripting language, Sophia, which can be formally verified, and a simpler language, Varna. Both natively support aeternity's first-class objects, such as contracts and oracles. While Sophia is more sophisticated, the gas usage of Varna contracts can be accurately estimated at compile time. Powerful, sophisticated contracts can be executed in both languages.

Name (DNS)
In the vein of Aaron Swartz’ work and Namecoin, æternity features an easy to use name system, that is both decentralized and secure, while still supporting human-friendly, memorable names. The blockchain’s state includes a mapping from unique human-friendly strings to fixed-size byte arrays, which are individually customizable.

Accounts and Identity
æternity's accounts are permission-less, but still allow customization. Create and own your identity on the æternity network - then use it everywhere on the web!
